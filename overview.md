As a practical exercise you can now test a few filters and thresholds to the images discussed in the lecture. Take a look on how the operations affect the images, both positive and negative, and how they affect the quantitative metrics.
## Filtering
The filtering section shows the effect of several different filters on an image and allows you to adjust the settings for both __Neigbhorhood Size__ (the range for included pixels) and the __Sigma__ value, which determines how strongly the distance a pixel is away from the point is weighted.
## Thresholding
The thresholding section shows the effect of different threshold values used. The image in this section comes from the Filtering section, so keep that in mind when choosing the threshold and interpreting the results.
## Questions
Some questions to trigger some discussions and considerations while changing the processing parameters, and comparing the quantitative results.
